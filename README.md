### Project Description
This is an interactive web app called "Enhanced Keyboard Pressure Tracker".
It tracks your keystrokes, typing speed, and style, and shows fun visual and sound effects depending on how hard/fast you press the keys.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
how we can detect the keyboard typing style of a person


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
solving it as calculated = release time ‚àí press time.

Typing style is determined based on that duration.

#### Project Documentation
For Software:  Project Title: Enhanced Keyboard Pressure Tracker

Purpose:
This software analyzes the user‚Äôs typing style by measuring how long each key is pressed. It provides real-time feedback on typing speed, pressure, and rhythm, helping users understand and improve their typing behavior.

#### Description:
The application captures the duration of each key press and categorizes the typing style into different levels such as Lightning Fast, Soft Baby Typing, Perfect Rhythm, Heavy Handed, and Keyboard Destroyer. It visually displays this information with emojis and descriptions, plays corresponding sound effects, and shows live statistics like total keys pressed, average key press time, and words per minute (WPM).

#### Technologies Used:

HTML for structure

CSS for styling

JavaScript for interactive functionality and logic

LocalStorage API for saving keystroke counts persistently

#### Key Features:

Real-time tracking of key press durations

Typing style classification with visual and audio feedback

Live statistics display including total keys pressed, average press time, and WPM

Persistent storage of keystroke count across browser sessions

Responsive user interface with dynamic background colors and animations

Use Case:
The software is intended for users interested in analyzing and improving their typing skills through interactive feedback and statistical insights.
